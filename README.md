You are required to apply the transfer learning on the following CNN models:
1. AlexNet
2. VGGNet
3. ResNet50
The steps to complete the task are as follows:
1. Split the data into 70:30% for training and testing. 
2. Apply Transfer learning by removing the appropriate layers of the network and add new layers as per your problem. Freeze the remaining network weights.
3. Use appropriate batch size, learning rate and optimization function while training the model.
4. Provide the learning curves (Training and validation loss, and training and validation accuracy).
5. Provide confusion matrix as well. Save the trained model.
6. Compare the three models and justify which model performs better and why?
